A script was developed for the IR829 that would scrape the Bus ID from the co-pilot and imbed this Bus ID
and device serial number into the remote-id and hexed into the IPv6 address, respectively, of the VPN client tunnel from
IR829 to the headend router.  Another script was developed to periodically ssh into the headend router
for this information and utilize APIs to update the Kinetic dashboard with the appropriate Bus
ID name for the associated gateway serial number.
